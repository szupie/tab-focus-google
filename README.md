# [Tab Focus through Google Results](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-focus-google/)
Use the tab key to navigate through Google and DuckDuckGo search results

This extension adds a tabindex attribute to each search result link.

**[Mac doesn't do tabbing by default](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility#using_native_keyboard_accessibility)**:
On a Mac, this will only work if you can already tab through elements in a page. If it doesn't work, you will probably have to turn on *Full Keyboard Access* under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, setting the radio to *All controls*. On Firefox, you may also try setting `accessibility.tabfocus` to `true` in *about:config*.

Also available as a [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/433135-tab-focus-through-google-search-results) if you use Greasemonkey ([gist here](https://gist.github.com/szupie/d50a7b9162b42bd352a96b7bebf50b5d)).
